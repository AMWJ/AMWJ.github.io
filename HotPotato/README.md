Hot Potato
====

Don't get stuck with it!

The objective of the game is to pass all the potatoes you have to other pods before their timers run out.

Remember:

* You can set a potato's name and timer duration when you make a potato. After that, its information cannot be changed.
* The timer resets when a potato is passed.
* You can't pass the potato after its timer runs out. The potato will rot after 6 hours.
